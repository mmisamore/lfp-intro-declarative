# Destroy All "If"s: An Intro to Declarative Programming in Prolog
## presented by Michael Misamore, Sept 2018

The title is a respectful nod to the inspiring [blog post](http://degoes.net/articles/destroy-all-ifs) by [John A De
Goes](http://degoes.net/).

The exposition owes a lot to Markus Triska's guide [The Power of Prolog](https://www.metalevel.at/prolog). Several code
ideas are reused from there, especially around CLP(FD).
